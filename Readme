Input Files
    -POM24 PRL OPOM FLAT FILE
        XLSX file that houses several fields from the OPOM extract


PYTHON FILES
    -POMFlatFileMutator.py
        Script that creates objects to utilize data from the POM Flat File
        Outputs Costlines.xlsx, LaborProfiles.xlsx, and Tasks.xlsx
    -Constants.py
        Holds several constants utilized in the below files
    -TaskCreator.py
        Holds two classes, Task and Tasks. Each line from the pom flat file is fed to the Task class and creates a Task
        object, it is added to Tasks if it is unique for later processing. Tasks houses all of the task objects and
        creates the dataframe for output
    -LaborProfilesCreator.Py
        Holds two classes LaborProfile and LaborProfiles, if it is a unique combination of inputs creates a labor profile
        added to the LaborProfiles object for later processing, LaborProfiles reates the dataframe and houses all of the
        laborprofiles
    -CostLineCreator.Py
        Operates like the above two just for CostLines. Creates the costline for ultimate use by the CORE Tool
    -Core.py
        Used for POMTool 1.0 which is OBE

OutputFiles
    -Tasks.xlsx
        Houses all the tasks created
    -LaborProfiles.xlsx
        Houses all of the profiles created
    -CostLines.xlsx
        Houses all of the costlines created


Remaining tasks:
    -Remaining Python Tasks:
        -Point year to correct column in POMFLatFile, Column Z houses the correct data just need to update the classes
        -Create logic for splitting each of the tasks, laborprofiles, costlines by unique funding profile and putting
            them into the tool for distribution
        -Create logic for receiving all of the disparate files from users into a single file that houses all of the
            updated values
    -Remaining VBA Tasks:
        -Create logic for updating labor profiles and tasks, need to affect the costlines tab once a change is made to
        either labor profiles or tasks.
        -Double check the logic for the save tasks and save profiles
        -Remove box for or implement filtering criteria for the task search panels
        -Finish manage cost form including the backend logic to update the costlines tab

    This is not necessarily a complete list, just what I can remember.

Basic Functionality
    -POMFlatFileMutator opens the POMFLatFile and creates the tasks, laborprofiles and costlines. Creates the dataframes
        then creates the excel files with the associated data
